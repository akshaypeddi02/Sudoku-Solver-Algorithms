# Sudoku-Solver-Algorithms

This GitHub repository contains all the code that was used to perform the comparative study between various Sudoku solving algorithms.

backtracking.py contains 3 algorithms:
  - Dumb backtracking with random cell selection
  - Backtracking with forward checking
  - Forward checking with heuristics (minimum remaining values, degree, and least constraining value heuristics)
